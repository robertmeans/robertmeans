      After waiting in the truck for nearly 2 hours the rain finally broke and we got this trip underway.

    I overpacked Stanton's pack so shortly into the hike I unloaded some of his heavy stuff into my pack and gave him the camera so he could document the tower of pain I'm carrying.</p>

  2.5 hour hike in landed us at a decent camping spot (hiking with headlamps) in a light drizzle, around 9:30 p.m. Here the kids wait patiently while Dad sets up home. All of our stuff was under the vestibule b/c of the rain. We had a Bushy-tailed woodrat come in and nibble on my pack that wouldn't scare away. I would shine my lamp in his face and yell (12 inches away!) and he'd go away only to return 90 seconds later. Shortly after midnight I couldn't take it anymore so I got up prepared to shoot that thing. Fortunately for him I tied everything up in bags and that was enough to keep him from eating our camping gear.</p>

  Friday hike up Fancy Pass.</p>

  This was the biggest bouquet of Columbines we've ever seen.</p>

  Summiting Fancy Pass</p>

  At the Pass we spotted a herd of big horn sheep - you can faintly make out their butts, skipping merrily single file along the scree where the green meets the rocks on the right hand side of the picture.</p>

  Site of Holy Cross "City" old mining town. We stumbled upon this 130 year old shack just in time for the afternoon downpour.</p>

  The last time we got caught in an afternoon storm we ended up huddled together between rocks wrapped in a trash bag. This is deluxe accommodations!</p>

  Closed off mine shaft</p>
  <p><img src="images/HolyCross17.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
  Another locked up mine. Imagine the miners with candels strapped to their heads crawling waaaaay down in there... *shiver*</p>
  <p><img src="images/HolyCross18.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
  We found a strawberry patch. Another item to add to our camp menu. They're tiny but really good!</p>
