  Around 8:00 PM when we took a ride in the golf cart and saw the bear. He was eating these apples too. He ran away too fast for me to get a picture. I've never seen the kids eat so much fruit. It was the neatest thing for them to pick these apples off the tree and eat them.</p>

  Later that night... I filled the tub in their room and let them enjoy the simple pleasures of a bedtimeless vacation night. This and the next picture speak for themselves...</p>

  This was Meredith when we got back from our visit with Dad &amp; Donna in Brevard. Stanton didn't go because he was alseep when we left. Both kids went to bed at 9:00 that night and didn't get up until 11:00 the next afternoon!</p>

  This is Kevin, my roommate from college. I have this on my Facebook page with the caption, &quot;Who could have pictured us like this 18 years ago?&quot;</p>

  A trip to North Carolina wouldn't be complete without Cheerwine. We finally found this at Target, our 4<sup>th</sup> stop before we got to the airport - of course, don't you know, they sold it at the airport!</p>

  Good bye NC.</p>

  Once we got home I opened my suitcase to get our toothbrushes out and get everyone to bed. Bandit immediately parked himself inside my suitcase and slept here all night.</p>
