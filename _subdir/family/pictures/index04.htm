    <p>Saturday, June 8, 1st Camping of 2013 - Waiting on Dad to finish taking pictures so we can get going. â€” at Near Slaughterhouse Gulch outside Conifer, CO.</p>
    <img src="images/07.08.13_camping02.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
    <p>Adventure underway. Check out the gear Santa brought them over the winter. This is the sight of Dad's pack losing 15+ pounds.</p>

    <p>Freestyling it up mountains has its challenges. Here we're scaling up precariously teetering rocks on the near vertical side of a mountain about 10,500' up.</p>
  <img src="images/07.08.13_camping03_2.jpg" width="1200" height="900" /> 
<p>We found what I can only describe as a quartz vein on the side of the mountain with chunks of quarts like we've never seen. Of "quartz" I didn't take a picture of it!</p>

<p>Sunset - after dinner but before we went on a dusk exploring adventure. We hiked with packs for ~4 hours to get to the top and they still had plenty of energy to want to investigate stuff that required another hour of hiking.</p>

<p>Sunday breakfast, June 9 - When randomly exploring the wilderness not every camping spot has endless sweeping vistas. We know the value of a flat spot no matter where it is.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 16, 2013 - Woke up on the side of a mountain somewhere. Just me & Stanton this round.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 16, 2013 - These new pinecones smelled soo good. Like strawberry cherry candy... we didn't eat any although we did discuss it. We did eat some dandilions.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 16, 2013 - Covered in scratches, bug spray and pollen after countless hours off trail just to get deeper into nowhere. It doesn't get any better than this. Happy Father's Day!</p>

<p>Friday, June 21, 2013 - Off into the woods for a couple of nights to one of our favorite spots discovered last year.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_02.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>This picture just makes me happy. Taking a break and taking it in.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_03.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>We're getting a little more creative with the food selection these days.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_04.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Since we're camping on solid rock I sent the kids on a rock-gathering mission while I set up camp. The rocks are for tethering our tent to something and so we could put on the rain fly.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_05.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>It was funny to watch them scaling up the rocks carrying these little boulders. They got 9 in all and worked like a perfect little team to get it done.</p>

<p>Playing Go Fish while dad makes dinner.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_07.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Good thing we prepared for rain. The first night we got a good dumping and heavy winds most of the night. If you listen to this picture you can hear them in the tent cracking up.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 22, 2013 about 5:45 a.m. - This is how I start my camping mornings. Note 2 coffees expired September of last year but as camp coffee goes; as long as it smells something like coffee and is hot, it's perfect.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_09.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Note the tent cloaked in shade to the left of my watch. They are still sound asleep.</p>

<p>Studying the underside of trees.</p>

<p>Snacking on dandilions</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_12.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Stanton &amp; I found a good clearing across a tiny gorge to throw the football.</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_13.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Stanton coaching Meredith back across another mini gorge. (You can't tell from this angle but these rocks are not connected. There's a good 40' drop between them.)</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_14.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Done!</p>
<img src="images/HolyRock_15.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
<p>Statewide fire ban won't prevent us from our evening SMORE's!</p>

<p>Sunday, June 23, 2013 - Loaded up & moving out. Another successful weekend of good old fashioned fun.</p>
