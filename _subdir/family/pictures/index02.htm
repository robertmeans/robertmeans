  <p>Thursday, July 19, 2012: Started the day with dissecting another gadget. This time it was my iPhone 3GS that got dropped in the kitchen sink a few weeks ago. It still worked but the screen was shot. Amazing little piece of technology.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Thursday, July 19, 2012: Headed to St. Mary's Glaicer but took a wrong turn and ended up on our own adventure. 4 wheeled up an insane trail and then hiked to a lake all above 11,000'.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Thursday, July 19, 2012: Standard Colorado views - nothing to see here...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/04.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Thursday, July 19, 2012: We hiked around the lake to the waterfall in the background and then to the top of the waterfall. It's amazing how quickly a lack of oxygen will destroy you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Thursday, July 19, 2012: Spotted a marmot lounging in the sun. We were checking him out just as much as he was checking us out.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/06.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: Back by popular demand - the kids insisted that we revisit yesterday's mountain hike and make it to the top this time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/07.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: We spent a total of 5.5 hours hiking and the kids showed exactly zero signs of boredom or fatigue.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/08.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: Both Stanton &amp; Meredith insist that we need to build a house at this spot and live here. We're definitely going back to camp here in the near future.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/09.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: Here we are at the top (well, almost - we didn't scale up the slate) of James Peak next to Ice Lake. It took us about 3 hours to hike up here. We saw lots of extremely rare wildlife too - sorry, no pictures... next time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: Inside an old abandoned gold mine about 12,500' up on the mountain. Whew, them gold miners weren't playing around. Clearly Meredith wasn't hip on this cave business.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/11.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: Funny, I started the day by reading a post on someone else's FB page that said, &quot;The best things in life are free.&quot; Point proven.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/12.jpg" width="960" height="695" /></p>
  <p>Friday, July 20, 2012: Back in the truck &amp; heading down. This hail storm pounded us about 90 seconds after we got back to the truck (perfect timing!) and the temperature dropped to about 45Â°.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/13.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Saturday, August 04, 2012 - We freestyled it up a mountain and lucked upon the perfect, most untouched, flat camping spot ever.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Arches in Mt. Evans Wildlife Wilderness Area, Evergreen, CO.</p>

  <p>Sunday, August 05, 2012 - breakfast...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/17.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Sunday, August 05, 2012 - ...with a view</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/18.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Purifying drinking water. Very much out in the middle of nowhere. I told the kids our purifier could pull potable water from raw sewage. Fortunately it never came to that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/19.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Unanimously agreed, this is what life is all about.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/20.jpg" width="960" height="700" /></p>
  <p>Wednesday, August 8, 2012 - More camping. I asked the kids Wednesday morning, &quot;Do you want to go camping or -&quot; and they both interrupted with &quot;GO CAMPING!&quot; They never even wanted to know what the &quot;or&quot; was.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/21.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>View from tent. Incredible spot, perfectly flat, facing west with rock dome over back of tent that provided dark shade &amp; cool temps until almost 11:00 a.m! I got up at 6:00, made coffee &amp; absorbed the serenity. Kids &amp; Bandit slept until after 10:00.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/22.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Our routine is to hike in for a couple of hours, off trail and typically straight up, until we find the perfect spot. I set up camp and then we all go back down to the stream and fill up on water. Round trip to get water this time: 1.5 hours. Behold, the most beautiful 6 pack ever.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/23.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></p>
  <p>Getting ready for S'mores. Note their shoes. The kids have mountain shoes &amp; boots but prefer to hike in their water shoes. They scale up &amp; down these mountains, with packs, like spider monkeys.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Meredith found this Aspen with carvings in the middle of nowhere. And when I say, &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; that is the understatement of the year. Seemingly random and facing a rock so that the one carving was positioned between the tree &amp; the rock with no view of the surrounding mountains - nothing about this makes sense. It's more involved than just some kid scribbling with his pocket knife.  </p>
