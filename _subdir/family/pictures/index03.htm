  <p>Friday, August 17, 2012 - Surprise, we went camping again. This time a 2-nighter. Same spot as last time because we're pretty sure it's the best place to camp in Colorado and we're the only ones to know about it.</p>

  <p>This water represents a lot of effort. 5 gallons of purified water, 45 minutes of pumping, carried up a mile+ of ladder-climbing ascent. Respect.</p>

  <p>This is the peak we climbed the next day. It should look further away because it is. We spent the better part of 6 hours trecking there &amp; back.</p>

  <p>Wouldn't be camping w/o S'mores.</p>

  <p>It's a shame I didn't get a good picture of this tree. Another curious oddity, existing unknown, discovered on our mountain exploring adventure.</p>

  <p>A tiny glimpse of what we scaled up to get to the top. I would throw our backpacks and Bandit up to the next rock and then spot Stanton &amp; Meredith as they climbed. Getting down was the scarrier part.</p>

  <p>Getting to the top!</p>

  <p>Neat stuff to investigate everwhere.</p>
