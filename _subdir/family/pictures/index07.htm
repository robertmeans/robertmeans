  Saturday, August 17, 2013 - Only 1 thing left to do this summer before school starts on Monday. Note the day packs. We're on a mission.</p>
  <p><img src="images/MtElbert_02.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
  We're off to climb the tallest mountain in Colorado, 2nd tallest in the Continental United States (Mt. Whitney in CA is taller by 61 feet). Out the door at 4:00 a.m. On trail by 7:00 a.m.</p>

  Made treeline and first glimpse of Elbert around 8:00 a.m. That's a false peak in the background. Summit is roughly another half hour (our speed) past what you see in the distance.</p>

  Micro-recovery/acclimation break along the way.</p>
  <p><img src="images/MtElbert_05.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
  I couldn't stop saying along the way, "See that mountain over there? We're going to be higher than that. See that mountain over there..."</p>
  <p><img src="images/MtElbert_06.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
  We're officially the highest family in Colorado and in fact all of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
  <p><img src="images/MtElbert_07.jpg" width="1200" height="900" />
  14,433 feet high (14ers.com), 9 miles, 4,700' vertical gain and 7 hours of hiking round trip.</p>
