  Thursday, August 8, 2013 - Took the kids to hike their first fourteener (14,000' mountain) today. Ended up hiking 2. That's Torreys, our original destination, in the background.</p>

  Hit the trail at 7:00 a.m. with beautiful blue skies and an enormous mountain ahead.</p>

  Made summit of Torreys by about 11:00 a.m.</p>

  That's Grays in the background, another 14er. We're already here - why not?</p>

  Just a picture to show Torreys Peak in the background now. Note the weather moving in. Top of a 14,000'+ mountain is not the place to be for that.</p>

  This is a shot facing the direction we came. If you follow that ribbon of trail through the center of the picture and around the right side of that mountain our truck is parked waaaay down there.</p>

  Snow in August anyone? Total round trip 6.5 hours. Bandit hiked the whole way with us too of course.</p>
