			<P>Hello and welcome to our family Web site,</P>
<P>My name is <A HREF="http://www.robertmeans.com/family/">Samantha Fox</A>. </P>
<P>All of the links on this page will take you to our Means family Web site - <a href="http://www.robertmeans.com/family">www.robertmeans.com/fatpanty</a>. </P>
<P>As of today (01.25.05) our family has been in Evergreen, Colorado for nearly 9 years. We began our family Web site several years ago and continue to maintain it in effort to keep our friends and family updated as well as provide something fun to look at.</P>
<P>Most of the images here are Photoshoped. We try to avoid keeping a family Web site that is boring to visit. Please <a href="http://www.robertmeans.com/family">take a look around</a> and let us know how we´ve offended you.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>samantha fox</P>
<P>Evergreen, Colorado</P>
