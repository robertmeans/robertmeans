    <li>Our experiences are much more what we put into them than what they originally contain.</li>

    <li>Whatever things and ideas symbolize within experience becomes their misleading actuality.</li>

    <li>There are no moral phenomena but only moral interpretations of phenomena. Moral matters have nothing to do with things &quot;in themselves&quot;; they are simply matters of oppinion. They are part of the world of appearance.</li>

    <li>Our &quot;truths&quot; are not accurate descriptions of a trancendental reality but simply statements that &quot;work&quot; and thus fit us for survival. (The most expedient form of error.)</li>

    <li>Does life’s absurdity require one to escape it through hope or suicide?</li>

    <li>Vanity is the skin of the soul.</li>
    
    <li>Everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth anything except through it.</li>
    
    <li>Is one to die voluntarily or to hope in spite of everything?</li>
    
    <li>The intoxication of the irrational – turn a lucid mind away from the absurd.</li>
    
    <li>The contrary of suicide is the man condemned to death.</li>
    
    <li>Life is a dead end path.</li>
    
    <li>The actor taught us there is no frontier between being and appearing.</li>
    
    <li>Man allows himself the tormenting luxury of fishing in a bathtub knowing nothing will become of it.</li>
    
    <li>Life is our terrifying apprenticeship with death.</li>

    <li>If the moment itself is eternity then eternity is the future returning as the past... while freedom of will implies separation from the whole... fate again places man in organic connection with the total development - free will as nothing but the highest potency of fate.</li>
    
    <li>A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world.</li>

    <li>The muteness of nature is beautiful and frightful in its great silence.</li>
    
    <li>Freedom exists only in a world where what is possible is defined at the same time as what is not possible. Without law there is no freedom.</li>

    <li>There is much I choose not to know. Wisdom places limits upon knowledge.</li>
    
    <li>To live is in itself a value judgement. To breathe is to judge.</li>
    
    <li>To live in a lawless world is impossible because to live explicitly implies a law. How can one live freely and without law?</li>

    <li>Man can live only in the indifference of his ignorance, &quot;clinging to the back of a tiger while enveloped in dreams.&quot;</li>
    
    <li>The innocence of the ceaseless change of things, as soon as one consents to it, represents maximum liberty.</li>
    
    <li>Everything that has existed is eternal. The sea throws it back on the shore.</li>
    
    <li>In the world even the best things are worthless apart from him who first presents them.</li>

    <li>Existence and the world are only justified as aesthetic phenomenon.</li>

    <li>All that exists is just and unjust and equally justified in both.</li>

    <li>There is neither good nor bad but thinking makes it so.</li>

    <li>There is no truth. All is permissible.</li>

    <li>Truth begins with two.</li>

    <li>All knowledge is an interpretation of being provided by a living and cognizing being. There is no truth that is not entertained in thought and believed.</li>    
    
    <li>The experience of all deep wells is slow: they must wait long until they know what has fallen into their depths.</li>
    
    <li>We invest reality into an idea and then take that idea to be reality. We live conditioned by the imagined reality of our concepts. – J. Goldstien</li>
    
    <li>We can’t know things in themselves we only know the external phenomenal world as it is mediated by the a prori forms of cognition. – Kant</li>
    
    <li>Life is an incurable disease with a very bad prognosis. It lingers on for years and invariably ends in death. – C.G. Jung</li>
    
    <li>We carry on like a prisoner winding his watch on the way to execution.</li>

    <li>Nothing lives that is worthy<br>
      Thy agitation, and the earth deserves not a sigh.<br>
      Our being is pain and boredom and the world<br>
      is dirt - nothing more. Be calm.</li>
