    <li>Either we are not free and God the all-powerful, is responsible for evil. Or we are free and responsible, but God is not all-powerful.</li>

    <li>Mystical explanations are regarded as profound: the truth is that they do not even go the length of being superficial. – FN, TGS 126</li>

    <li>When was the last time someone was criticized for not respecting another person’s unfounded beliefs about physics or history?</li>

    <li>“What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.” – Christopher Hitchens</li>

    <li>Our religions have seized upon ancient taboos and prescientific fancies as though the held ultimate metaphysical significance.</li>

    <li>To presume knowledge where there is only hope is a species of evil.</li>

    <li>What, apart from a fundamental willingness to be reasonable, can guarantee that we will keep talking to one another?</li>

    <li>Weariness that wants to reach the ultimate with one leap, with one fatal leap, a poor weariness that does not want to want any more; this created all gods and other worlds. – FN, TSZ</li>

    <li>Faith is the license people give themselves to keep believing when reason fails.</li>

    <li>Shatter the law tables of the never joyful.</li>

    <li>The good – cannot create: they crucify him who writes new values, they sacrifice the future to themselves. The good have always been the beginning of the end.</li>

    <li>Individual atheists may do evil things, but they don’t do evil things in the name of atheism. No wars are fought in the name of atheism.</li>

    <li>The trademark of the faith-based moralizer is to care passionately about what other people think in private.</li>

    <li>“Those who can get you to believe absurdities can get you to commit atrocities.” – Voltaire</li>

    <li>Religion teaches that unquestioned faith is a virtue.</li>

    <li>Christianity institutionalized guilt and made it a virtue.</li>

    <li>Pope Benedict XVI abolished limbo. – Where does everyone formerly in limbo go now? Were all the previous Popes wrong despite their infallibility? This is the kind of thing we’re supposed to “respect.”</li>

    <li>The Bible is not a sufficient justification of beliefs, given the standards off evidence that prevailed at the time of its composition.</li>

    <li>The fact that faith has motivated many people to do good things does not suggest that faith itself is a necessary (or even good) motivation for goodness. It’s possible, even reasonable, to do good without believing incredible ideas about the nature of the universe. By contrast, the most monstrous crimes against humanity have been inspired by unjustified belief.</li>

    <li>The problem with Scripture is that many of its possible interpretations (including most of the literal ones) can be used to justify atrocities in defense of faith.</li>

    <li>While there is an opposition between reason and faith, there is none between reason and love or reason and spirituality.</li>

    <li>Faith is hunger; while reason is its food.</li>

    <li>Crimes without victims are like debts without creditors. The idea that religion is the source of ethical intuitions is absurd. We no more get our sense that cruelty is wrong from the Bible than we get our sense that 2 + 2 = 4 from a math textbook. Concern for others was not the invention of any prophet.</li>

    <li>The deity who stalked the deserts of the middle east millennia ago – and who seems to have abandoned them to bloodshed in his name ever since – is no one to consult on questions of ethics.</li>

    <li>“Apart from logical cogency, there is to me something a little odd about the ethical valuations of those who think that an omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent deity, after preparing the ground by many millions of years of lifeless nebulae, would consider himself adequately rewarded by the final emergence of Hitler and Stalin and the H-Bomb.” – Bertrand Russell</li>

    <li>Belief is always needed where there is lack of will. That is to say, the less a person knows how to command, the more urgent his desire for that which commands.</li>

    <li>Fanaticism is the volitional strength to which the weak and irresolute can be excited.</li>

    <li>Morality is the herd instinct in the individual. – FN, TGS 116</li>

    <li>The Christian resolution to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad. FN, TGS 130</li>

    <li>Although the most intelligent judges of the witches and even the witches themselves, were convinced of the guild of witchcraft, the guilt, nevertheless, was not there so it is with all guilt. – FN, TGS 250</li>

    <li>Religion gives people bad reasons to be good when good reasons exist. – Sam Harris</li>

    <li>I’d rather have questions I can’t answer than answers I can’t question. – Sam Harris</li>

    <li>Every true faith is infallible inasmuch as it accomplishes what the person who has the faith hopes to find in it: but faith does not offer the least support for a proof of objective proof.</li>
